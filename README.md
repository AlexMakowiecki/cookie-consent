## What is it? 
It's a website that tries to sell you a scammy course, and after a few seconds it shows you a popup window that asks for your data, again, in a scammy way. The website it's only to practice Javascript and a little of CSS, the information actually will not go to any other place.
This project is part of Module 5, where they teach you essential Javascript concepts. 
## What did I use?
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
## Concepts learned for this project and practiced during it
  - **setTimeout()** to run a function after x milliseconds
    - ```Javascript
      setTimeout(function(){}, 3000) // will run after 3 seconds
      ```
  - **preventDefault()** in event parameter to prevent default functions of events.
    - ```Javascript
      element.addEventListener("submit", function(e){
        e.preventDefault
      }) // To prevent forms from redirect the user to other pages (or visually reloading the page)
      ```
  - **disabled** attribute for interactive elements, to prevent the user from interacting with them, and add a visual change to clarify that. 
  - **classList** to manage the classes of an element in Javascript
    - ```Javascript
      element.classList.toggle("className") // To add the class when is not present, or remove it otherwise
      ```
  - **style** to manage the style attribute for HTML elements in Javascript.
    - ```Javascript
      element.style.display = "none"
      element.style.backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF" // use of Camel case for properties with "-"
      ```
  - **Forms** to make a form area in HTML, and improve input management in Javascript and accessibility.
    - `<label>` to add a description for the input
      - **for** property, to link the label with the input with the id passed as value, so for example, when the user clicks on the label, the focus goes to the input.
    - **type** property for `<input>` and `<button>`
      - for `<input>` is to declare which values the input accepts.
        - ```HTML
          <input type="number"/> <!--- Only accepts numbers --->
          ```
      - for `<button>` is to declare the function of the button. The default type in a form is "submit"
        - ```HTML
          <button type="button"><button> <!--- To make buttons that not activate the submit event --->
          ```
    - **required** input attribute, to prevent the user from submitting the form if the input has no value. 
    - **name** input attribute, to later manage the data entered in Javascript, using FormData. 
    - **FormData** to manage the data entered in the form, in Javascript. 
      - ```Javascript
        const newFormData = new FormData(formHtmlElement)
        ```
      - `get()` to get the values entered in the form, using the name attribute to select the specific inputs.
        - ```Javascript
            const name = newFormData.get("name")
          ```
